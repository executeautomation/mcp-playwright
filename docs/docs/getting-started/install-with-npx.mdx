# Install with npx

This is the quickest way to run the Playwright MCP server locally.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (20+ recommended)
- `npx` (bundled with recent Node.js releases)
- Playwright browsers (installed automatically on first run or via `npx playwright install`)

## Install & Run

```bash
npx @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server
```

To keep a global install:

```bash
npm install -g @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server
playwright-mcp-server
```

## Streamable HTTP mode

```bash
npx @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server --http \
  --port 8000 \
  --path /mcp \
  --host-name localhost \
  --listen 0.0.0.0
```

This enables the server to run behind MCP gateways. When HTTP mode is on, file uploads must go through the `construct_upload_url` tool before calling `playwright_upload_file`.

## VS Code configuration

Add the server to `mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

For HTTP transport:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "transport": {
        "type": "http",
        "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

# Release Notes

## Version 1.0.11 (December 2025)

### 🔐 Enhanced API Authentication & Code Quality Improvements

**Major Enhancement:** Comprehensive authentication support and significant code quality improvements for all API request methods!

This release brings production-ready authentication capabilities to all API methods (GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE), along with improved type safety, validation, and comprehensive documentation.

#### ✨ What's New

**1. Bearer Token Authentication for All Methods**
```javascript
// GET with authentication
await playwright_get({
  url: 'https://api.example.com/protected-data',
  token: 'your-bearer-token'
});

// DELETE with authentication
await playwright_delete({
  url: 'https://api.example.com/resource/123',
  token: 'your-bearer-token'
});

// PUT with authentication
await playwright_put({
  url: 'https://api.example.com/resource/123',
  value: '{"status":"active"}',
  token: 'your-bearer-token'
});
```

**2. Custom Headers Support**
```javascript
// Basic authentication
await playwright_get({
  url: 'https://api.example.com/data',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Basic dXNlcjpwYXNz',
    'X-API-Version': '2.0'
  }
});

// API Key authentication
await playwright_post({
  url: 'https://api.example.com/data',
  value: '{"name":"test"}',
  headers: {
    'X-API-Key': 'your-api-key',
    'X-Request-ID': 'unique-id'
  }
});
```

**3. Flexible Authentication Options**
```javascript
// Combine token with additional headers
await playwright_get({
  url: 'https://api.example.com/data',
  token: 'bearer-token',
  headers: {
    'X-Custom-Header': 'value'
  }
});

// Custom Authorization header overrides token
await playwright_get({
  url: 'https://api.example.com/data',
  token: 'this-is-ignored',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Basic xyz123'  // Takes precedence
  }
});
```

## Version 1.0.9 (December 2025)

### 🔧 Critical Fix: Console Output Buffering with npx

**Fixed:** Console output not visible when running via `npx`

**Problem:**
When running `npx @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server --port 8931`, users experienced no console output, making it impossible to verify if the server started successfully or see connection information.

**Root Cause:**
Node.js buffers `console.log()` output when stdout is not a TTY (terminal). When npx runs the server, it detects a non-interactive environment and buffers output indefinitely, preventing users from seeing any feedback.

**Solution:**
- Replaced `console.log()` with `process.stdout.write()` for immediate, unbuffered output
- Updated `src/index.ts` initialization message
- Updated `src/http-server.ts` startup banner

**Impact:**
Users now see immediate console output including:
- ⏳ Server initialization message
- 🚀 Server startup confirmation  
- 📋 All endpoint URLs (SSE, Messages, MCP, Health)
- 📝 Client configuration example
- 📊 Monitoring server information

**Testing:**
Verified with local npm package testing using `npm pack` and `npx` to ensure the fix works correctly before publishing.

**Files Changed:**
- `src/index.ts` - Line 65
- `src/http-server.ts` - Line 18

## Version 1.0.8 (December 2025)

### 🖥️ Console Output Improvements

**Fixed:** Console output visibility when running in HTTP mode

- Changed console output from `stderr` to `stdout` for better visibility
- Now displays initialization message: `⏳ Initializing Playwright MCP Server on port {port}...`
- Shows complete server startup information including endpoints and configuration
- Improved user experience when starting the server with `--port` flag

**Before:** No visible console output when running `npx @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server --port 8931`

**After:** Clear, formatted output showing:
- Server initialization status
- Listening address and port
- Available endpoints (SSE, Messages, MCP, Health Check)
- Client configuration example
- Monitoring server information

This makes it much easier to verify that the server has started successfully and provides all necessary connection information at a glance.

## Version 1.0.7 (December 2025)

### 🌐 HTTP/SSE Transport Mode (New!)

Added standalone HTTP server mode for enhanced deployment flexibility:

```bash
playwright-mcp-server --port 8931
```

**Key Features:**
- Full support for Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport using MCP SDK's native `SSEServerTransport`
- Multiple concurrent client sessions with automatic session management
- Health check endpoint (`/health`) for monitoring server status
- Dual endpoint support: `/sse` + `/messages` (legacy) and `/mcp` (unified, recommended)
- Graceful shutdown with proper resource cleanup
- [Read the full HTTP/SSE Transport Guide](/docs/playwright-web/HTTP-SSE-Transport)

**Configuration Example:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8931/mcp",
      "type": "http"
    }
  }
}
```

:::warning CRITICAL REQUIREMENT
The `"type": "http"` field is **REQUIRED** for HTTP/SSE transport. Without it, the client will not connect properly.
:::

### 🚀 Enhanced Deployment Options
- Run on remote servers without display (headless mode)
- Better integration with VS Code GitHub Copilot and custom MCP clients
- Support for background service deployment
- Multiple client access with session isolation
- Debugging capabilities with metrics endpoint (PORT+1)

### 📊 Code Quality & Maintainability
- **40% code reduction** in endpoint handlers through DRY refactoring
- Single source of truth for SSE connection and message handling
- Improved maintainability and consistency across all endpoints
- Enhanced logging with context-aware messages
- Reduced bug risk through centralized error handling

### 🔒 Security Enhancements
- **CRITICAL FIX:** Server now binds to 127.0.0.1 (localhost only) by default
- Prevents external network access and accidental exposure
- Clear security notification in startup message
- SSH tunneling documented for secure remote access

### 🔍 Debugging & Observability
- Comprehensive request logging middleware (logs all HTTP requests)
- Session lifecycle tracking with active transport counts
- Enhanced error diagnostics with detailed context
- Structured JSON logging for easy parsing
- Clear troubleshooting messages

### ✅ Backward Compatibility
- Default stdio mode unchanged (fully compatible with Claude Desktop)
- All existing tools work in both transport modes
- No breaking changes to existing configurations
- All 110 tests passing

### 🔧 stdio Mode Improvements
- **Fixed:** Logging in stdio mode now writes to file only (not stdout)
- **Fixed:** Monitoring system disabled in stdio mode to prevent console output
- **Fixed:** Log file path uses home directory to avoid permission issues
- **Result:** Clean JSON-RPC communication with Claude Desktop
- Logs available in `~/playwright-mcp-server.log`

### 🛠️ Infrastructure
- Logging system integration with HTTP transport
- Monitoring system for metrics collection (dynamic port allocation)
- Rate limiting framework (ready for future use)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Automatic port conflict resolution for monitoring server

### 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: "No transport found for sessionId" error**

Solution:
1. Ensure `"type": "http"` is present in your configuration
2. Check server logs show this sequence:
   - GET request to `/mcp`
   - "Transport registered" with sessionId
   - POST messages with same sessionId
3. Restart both server and client if needed

**Issue: Can't connect from another machine**

This is by design for security. Server binds to localhost only. For remote access:
```bash
ssh -L 8931:localhost:8931 user@remote-server
```

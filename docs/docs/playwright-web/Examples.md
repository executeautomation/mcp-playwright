Given I navigate to website http://eaapp.somee.com and click login link
And I enter username and password as "admin" and "password" respectively and perform login

And click "Create New" button and enter realistic employee details to create for Name, Salary, DurationWorked,
Select dropdown for Grade as CLevel and Email.

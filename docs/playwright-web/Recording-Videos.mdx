# Recording Videos

The MCP Playwright server supports recording videos of browser sessions. This feature is useful for debugging, documentation, and creating demos.

## Starting Video Recording

To start recording a video, use the `playwright_start_video` tool:

```json
{
  "name": "playwright_start_video",
  "parameters": {
    "path": "/path/to/save/videos", // Optional - defaults to user's Videos folder
    "width": 1280,                  // Optional - defaults to 1280
    "height": 720                   // Optional - defaults to 720
  }
}
```

When you start video recording:

1. The current browser session is closed
2. A new browser session with video recording enabled is created
3. If you were on a specific URL, the new session will navigate back to it

## Stopping Video Recording

To stop recording and save the video file, use the `playwright_stop_video` tool:

```json
{
  "name": "playwright_stop_video",
  "parameters": {}
}
```

When you stop video recording:

1. The current browser context is closed, which automatically saves the video
2. A new browser context without video recording is created
3. If you were on a specific URL, the new session will navigate back to it

## Video Format and Location

- Videos are saved in the WebM format
- By default, videos are saved to the user's Videos folder
- Each page in a browser context creates its own video file
- Video files are named automatically with a timestamp
- The resolution is determined by the width and height parameters (default: 1280x720)

## Example Usage

Here's a complete example of starting a browser session, recording a video, and then stopping the recording:

```json
// First, navigate to a website
{
  "name": "playwright_navigate",
  "parameters": {
    "url": "https://example.com"
  }
}

// Start video recording
{
  "name": "playwright_start_video",
  "parameters": {
    "path": "/my/videos/folder",
    "width": 1920,
    "height": 1080
  }
}

// Perform some actions...
{
  "name": "playwright_click",
  "parameters": {
    "selector": "#my-button"
  }
}

// Stop recording
{
  "name": "playwright_stop_video",
  "parameters": {}
}
```

## Technical Notes

- Video recording uses Playwright's built-in video recording capabilities
- Starting a recording requires creating a new browser context
- Stopping a recording requires closing the browser context
- Video files are saved when the context is closed
- The feature works in headless and headful browser modes

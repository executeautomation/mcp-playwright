## [Documentation](https://executeautomation.github.io/mcp-playwright/) | [API reference](https://executeautomation.github.io/mcp-playwright/docs/playwright-web/Supported-Tools)

## Installation

You can install the package using either npm, mcp-get, or Smithery:

Using npm:
```bash
npm install -g @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server
```

Using mcp-get:
```bash
npx @michaellatman/mcp-get@latest install @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server
```
Using Smithery

To install Playwright MCP for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server):

```bash
npx @smithery/cli install @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server --client claude
```
#### Installation in VS Code

Install the Playwright MCP server in VS Code using one of these buttons:

<!--
// Generate using?:
const config = JSON.stringify({ name: 'playwright', command: 'npx', args: ["-y", "@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server"] });
const urlForWebsites = `vscode:mcp/install?${encodeURIComponent(config)}`;
// Github markdown does not allow linking to `vscode:` directly, so you can use our redirect:
const urlForGithub = `https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect?url=${encodeURIComponent(urlForWebsites)}`;
-->

[<img alt="Install in VS Code Insiders" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code_Insiders-VS_Code_Insiders?style=flat-square&label=Install%20Server&color=24bfa5">](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode-insiders%3Amcp%2Finstall%3F%257B%2522name%2522%253A%2522playwright%2522%252C%2522command%2522%253A%2522npx%2522%252C%2522args%2522%253A%255B%2522-y%2522%252C%2522%2540executeautomation%252Fplaywright-mcp-server%2522%255D%257D)

Alternatively, you can install the Playwright MCP server using the VS Code CLI:

```bash
# For VS Code
code --add-mcp '{"name":"playwright","command":"npx","args":["@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server"]}'
```

```bash
# For VS Code Insiders
code-insiders --add-mcp '{"name":"playwright","command":"npx","args":["@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server"]}'
```

After installation, the ExecuteAutomation Playwright MCP server will be available for use with your GitHub Copilot agent in VS Code.

## Configuration to use Playwright Server
Here's the Claude Desktop configuration to use the Playwright server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Docker Support

The Playwright MCP Server can be run in Docker for isolated and containerized execution.

### Building the Docker Image

Before building the Docker image, you need to build the TypeScript project with production dependencies:

```bash
# Install production dependencies and build
npm install --omit=dev
npm run build

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t mcp-playwright .
```

Or use the provided convenience script:

```bash
chmod +x docker-build.sh
./docker-build.sh
```

### Running with Docker

You can run the MCP server using Docker in several ways:

#### Using Docker directly

```bash
# Run the server (stdin/stdout communication)
docker run -i mcp-playwright
```

#### Using Docker Compose

A `docker-compose.yml` file is provided for easier management:

```bash
# Run the server with docker-compose
docker compose run --rm playwright-mcp
```

### Using Docker with MCP Clients

To use the Dockerized server with Claude Desktop or other MCP clients, you can configure them to use Docker:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "mcp-playwright"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: The Docker image uses a Debian-based slim Node.js image and includes only the core dependencies. Playwright browsers are not pre-installed in the container to keep the image size small. The browsers will be downloaded on first use if needed.

## Testing

This project uses Jest for testing. The tests are located in the `src/__tests__` directory.

### Running Tests

You can run the tests using one of the following commands:

```bash
# Run tests using the custom script (with coverage)
node run-tests.cjs

# Run tests using npm scripts
npm test           # Run tests without coverage
npm run test:coverage  # Run tests with coverage
npm run test:custom    # Run tests with custom script (same as node run-tests.cjs)
```

The test coverage report will be generated in the `coverage` directory.

### Running evals

The evals package loads an mcp client that then runs the index.ts file, so there is no need to rebuild between tests. You can load environment variables by prefixing the npx command. Full documentation can be found [here](https://www.mcpevals.io/docs).

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key  npx mcp-eval src/evals/evals.ts src/tools/codegen/index.ts
```

## Contributing

When adding new tools, please be mindful of the tool name length. Some clients, like Cursor, have a 60-character limit for the combined server and tool name (`server_name:tool_name`).

Our server name is `playwright-mcp`. Please ensure your tool names are short enough to not exceed this limit.
